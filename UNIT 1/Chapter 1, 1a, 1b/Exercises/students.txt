You are given a list of students' names and their test scores. Design an algorithm that does the following:

a. Calculates the average test scores.
	Get testScore
	sumTestScores = sum of all test scores
	numTest = Number of Tests
	averageTestScore = sumTestScores / numTest

b. Determines and prints the names of all the students whose test scores are below the average test score.
	get a testScore
	if testScore < averageTestScore 
	print studentName

c. Determines the highest test score.
	Get student test score and call it hightestTestScore
	Repeat
	testScore
	if testScore > hightestTestScore
	highestTestScore = testScore

d. Prints the names of all the students whose test scores are the same as the highest test score. 
	Get studentName
	Get testScore
	if testScore = hightestTestScore
	print studentName
