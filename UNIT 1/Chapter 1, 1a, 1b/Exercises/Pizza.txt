Problem: Given the radius, in inches, and price of a pizza, design an algorithm to find the price of the pizza per square inch

Algorithm:
Radius given
Price given
1. Find Area of a Pizza
      area = 3.14 * (r)^2
2. Find the price per square inch by dividing the price with the area of the pizza
 	pricePsi: Price per square inch
	price: Price of a pizza
		pricePsi = price / area
