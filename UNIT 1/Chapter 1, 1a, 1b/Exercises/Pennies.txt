   There are 25 pennies in a quarter.Therefore convert the quarters into pennies by multiplying them by 25.
2. Get the numbers of dimes in the change
   There are 10 pennies in a dime.Therefore convert the dimes into pennies by multiplying them by 10
3. Get the numbers of nickels in the change
   There 5 pennies in a nickel.Therefore convert the nickels into pennies by multiplying them by 5
4. Calculate the sum of, the calculated pennies from the quarters, dimes, nickels, and the pennies that were    already in the change.
	Pennies = Q*25+D*10+N*5+P
