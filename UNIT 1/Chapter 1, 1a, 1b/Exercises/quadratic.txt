Design an algorithm to find the real roots of a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c , where a, b, and c are real numbers, and a is nonzero. 

Algorithm:

	Get a
	Get b
	Get c 
	v = square root of
	
	w = b*b - 4*a*c

	if w < 0 
	print 'No Real Roots'
	if w = 0
	roots = -b/(2a)
	if w > 0
	roots = (-b-v(w))/(2a) , (-b+v(w))/(2a)
