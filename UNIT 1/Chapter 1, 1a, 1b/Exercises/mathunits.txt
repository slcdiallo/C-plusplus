A student spends a majority of his weekend playing and watching sports, thereby tiring him out and leading him to oversleep and often miss his Monday 8 AM math class. Suppose that the tuition per semester is $25,000 and the average semester consists of 15 units. If the math class meets three days a week, one hour each day for 15 weeks, and is a four-unit course, how much does each hour of math class cost the student? Design an algorithm that computes the cost of each math class.

Solution

Tuition per semester = $25,000
Average semester is 15 units
costUnit = 25,000 / 15 = $1,666.667 per unit
Cost of 4 units of Math = 1,666.67 * 4 = $6,666.667
There are 45 hours of math in 15 weeks of classes
Therefore each hour of math class cost is = $6,666.667 / 45 = $148.148

Algorithm

Get Tuition per semester = semesterTuition
units = number of units in a semester
costUnit = semesterTuition / units
mathUnits = number of units of math 
costMathUnits = mathUnits * costUnit
