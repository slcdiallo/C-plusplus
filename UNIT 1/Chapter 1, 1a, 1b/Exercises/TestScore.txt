Problem: Find weighted average of four test scores.

Algorithm: 
1. Get each test score (testScore1, testScore2, testScore3, testScore4)
2. Get its weight (weightTestScore1, weightTestScore2, weightTestScore3, weightTestScore4)
3. Calculate Weighted Average which is the sum of the each test score multiply by its own weight
	weightedAverage = testScore1 * weightTestScore1 + testScore2 * weightTestScore2 + testScore3 * weightTestScore3 + testScore4 * weightTestScore4
